# 🌍 Climate Trends: Data Analysis & Prediction

This repository contains a customized analysis of historical climate data to identify global trends, understand the impact of climate change, and develop predictive models to anticipate future scenarios.

## 📌 Project Purpose
The main goals of this analysis are to:
- Examine historical data on global and regional temperatures.
- Visualize patterns and trends that explain climate behavior.
- Build reliable predictive models that can be used for scientific studies and awareness efforts.

## 🛠️ Technologies and Tools Used
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries for Analysis and Modeling:**
  - Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn for graphical visualization.
  - Statsmodels for time series modeling.
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook for clear and reproducible analysis.

## 📂 Dataset
This project uses historical data provided by **Berkeley Earth**, including:
- Global temperature variations on land and ocean surfaces.
- Data broken down by country, state, and major city.
- Long-term climate records with high precision.

## 🚀 Analysis Features
1. **Data Exploration:**
   - Descriptive and statistical analysis of global temperatures.
   - Identification of seasonal patterns and anomalies.
2. **Customized Visualizations:**
   - Interactive graphs showcasing historical trends.
   - Heatmaps highlighting key geographic areas.
3. **Predictive Modeling:**
   - Implementation of an optimized ARIMA model.
